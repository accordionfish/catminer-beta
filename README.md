# Cat Miner
>Note:Cat miner is in _beta_ currently. When 1.0 comes out, cat miner will be fully released, with a custom domain (and ads to keep the domain running but they won't be intrusive)

Ok, so for whoever doesn't know, cat miner started as just a sort of idle game that I made, and it was just a font awesome cat and a pickaxe mining air.

After that, I updated it a little bit more, changed the UI,
made the space bar give you more money than you make idly, and added upgrades.

Now, it just looks the same, with minor changes, and bug fixes. But look out for new features, because they're coming!
